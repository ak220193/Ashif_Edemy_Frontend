                            <p>After 12th grade, every learner is engaged in identifying a suitable programme of study to continue learning and build a better career. Many learners are unaware of the options open to them based on their interests and hence face difficulty in choosing the programmes or courses they want to pursue after the 12th grade. It is always preferable to understand various facts of relevant programmes of study based on oneâ€™s interest and then choose a discipline based on the learners' preferences and abilities. This kind of career planning will help to choose the correct programme, and this will ensure learners achieve their life goals.</p>
